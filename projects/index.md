# 👋 Hi, I'm Mohamed Kamil  
**IT Enthusiast | Security Learner | Future Blue Teamer**  
*Building secure systems and hunting vulns—one lab at a time.*

---

## 🚀 Current Mission  
I'm documenting my journey into cybersecurity through hands-on projects while pursuing my *Formación Profesional de Grado Medio en Sistemas Microinformáticos y Redes*.  

**What excites me:**  
- Dissecting how attacks work (ethically!)  
- Building defensive tools  
- Turning theory into practice through home labs  

> *"It's not about breaking things—it's about learning how they break so we can build them stronger."*
