Hi, Iâ€™m Mohamed Kamil â€” a native Spanish speaker and IT enthusiast focused on networking, microcomputing, and cybersecurity. Iâ€™m currently in Year 2 of Vocational Training in Microcomputer Systems and Networks, developing practical skills through labs and hands-on projects.  

When Iâ€™m not building my technical expertise, I enjoy cycling, practicing judo ðŸ¥‹, and exploring the world through documentaries, videogames, and time with animals.  

Iâ€™m always open to connecting with professionals in networking and cybersecurity, so feel free to reach out!
