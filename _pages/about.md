Hi, I’m Mohamed Kamil — an IT and cybersecurity enthusiast on a mission to break things (ethically, of course 🔍💻). I document my learning journey here through projects, home labs, and experiments—all while figuring out which corner of cybersecurity I’ll conquer next.

Currently, I’m in Year 2 of Formación Profesional de Grado Medio en Sistemas Microinformáticos y Redes (Vocational Training in Microcomputer Systems & Networks). When I’m not nerding out over firewalls or Python scripts, you’ll find me outdoors: lifting my body (calisthenics), lifting bikes (cycling), or gently lifting opponents (judo 🥋).

What’s brewing?
Building a SIEM lab + honeypot soon! Stay tuned—or better yet, reach out if you love talking networks, security, or judo throws.
